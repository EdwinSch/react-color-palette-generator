## Color Palette Generator (React)

A small React project which calculates and renders percentual color steels/shades based on a single color input. The input can be picked from the color picker or any hex code can be entered into the text field. All results can be copied to the clipboard by clicking.

Showcasing: input/form handling, state handling, components and the usage of multiple libraries. Made in Vite + CSS.
